# Melody Mod
A mod to make it easier to play Melody's Harp on Hypixel Skyblock		https://hypixel.net/threads/mod-melody-mod.2483213/

Isn't it hard to complete the harp songs? Now imagine that but with a laptop mousepad, it's close to impossible!

And because of that i present to you, **THE MELODY MOD!** With this mod you can assign keys to different notes so it becomes easier to play them, for example, with a mousepad.

**Features:**
* Reassign every key to a note and play them in the harp
* Detects if you're inside the harp GUI and does not trigger outside of it

**NOTE:** This mod is like most mods used on your own risk, I will not take responsibility in any consequences from using this mod.
